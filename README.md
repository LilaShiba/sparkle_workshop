    <p>Project Sparkle is a creative workshop where students blend coding, design, and wearable tech to build magical, futuristic fashion. No experience needed — just curiosity and imagination! 🌈🎉</p>

    <p>Together, students learn sewing, programming, and how to turn an idea into reality. Examples include dresses, hats, bags, shoes, bell-bottoms, and more.</p>
